### EVA4
#### This repo contains general code and utilities used throughout the EVA4 Course that I am currently enrolled.
##### CPPBuillderColab.ipynb
    This Notebook allows you to use Libtorch C++ Frontend APIs on Google Colab.
    It will allow you to create required C++ files (.cpp/.h) in individual cells and also compile and execute them in the Colab framework.
    The model used in this notebook is taken EVA4 course offered by "The School of AI" and our awesome mentor Rohan Shravan.
    I will create a medium article shortly listing the basic setup steps.
    Please feel free to comment on my github link for any improvements.
##### example-cpp
    This folder contains the code used in CPPBuilderColab.ipynb. The model is presented by Rohan Shravan in the original class and has been     adapted with libtorch and CPP frontend to generate a C++ binary.
#### Further enhancements:
    1. Automate CMake procedures.
    2. Evaluate xeus-cling integration to have more seamless and true Jupyteresque way of writing C++ code.
    3. Build more utilities to be used in model training (Model Checkpointing, Learning Rate evaluator and Keras styled callbacks)
